1. **What are variables and why do we use them in JavaScript?**
   Variables are containers for storing data (values), and we use them for storing and keeping track of values and data in a JavaScript program.

   

2. **What is the correct syntax for a single-line comment in JavaScript?**

   ```javascript
   // a short, one-line comment
   ```

   

3. **What are the different ways of creating a variable in JavaScript?**
   We can create a variable using the `let` or `const` keyword. The main difference between `let` and `const` variables is:

   - A `let` variable allows you to reassign (change) the value stored in the variable at a later time.
   - A`const` variable is a *constant* variable. Once a `const` variable is created and assigned a value it can't be changed.

   

4. **For what do we use the `console.log()` function?**
   The `console.log()` function is used for printing text or other values to the console. It is commonly used for debugging, or when trying to understand how a JavaScript program is working or to just simply output a message to the console.
